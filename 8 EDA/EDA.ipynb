    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is used to see what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. It's a crucial step in the data analysis process that helps data scientists to understand the data, detect anomalies, discover patterns, and formulate hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use EDA?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Data Structure**: Helps in understanding the underlying structure and relationships in the data.\n",
    "2. **Detecting Outliers**: Identifies anomalies or outliers that could affect analysis.\n",
    "3. **Finding Patterns**: Reveals patterns, trends, and correlations.\n",
    "4. **Testing Assumptions**: Tests underlying assumptions required for statistical models.\n",
    "5. **Generating Hypotheses**: Formulates hypotheses based on observed data patterns.\n",
    "6. **Preparing for Modeling**: Assists in data cleaning, feature selection, and transformation before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to Use EDA?\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is used in various stages and applications:\n",
    "- **Before Model Building**: To ensure the data is well-understood and clean.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: To detect and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: To create new features or modify existing ones based on insights gained.\n",
    "- **Hypothesis Testing**: To generate hypotheses for further statistical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gathering the data from various sources.\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting errors, and dealing with outliers.\n",
    "3. **Data Transformation**: Normalizing, scaling, and encoding data for analysis.\n",
    "4. **Data Visualization**: Creating various plots to visualize the data.\n",
    "5. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating summary statistics to understand the data distribution.\n",
    "6. **Hypothesis Generation and Testing**: Formulating and testing hypotheses based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods and Techniques Used in EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "- **Mean, Median, Mode**: Measure central tendency.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation, Variance**: Measure dispersion.\n",
    "- **Skewness, Kurtosis**: Measure the shape of the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Univariate Analysis** (Analyzing a single variable)\n",
    "   - **Histogram**: Shows the distribution of a single numeric variable.\n",
    "   - **Box Plot**: Highlights the median, quartiles, and outliers of a numeric variable.\n",
    "   - **Density Plot**: Smooth curve to show the distribution of a numeric variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bivariate Analysis** (Analyzing two variables)\n",
    "   - **Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between two numeric variables.\n",
    "   - **Bar Chart**: Compares the frequency or count of different categories.\n",
    "   - **Line Plot**: Visualizes trends over time for two variables.\n",
    "   - **Hexbin Plot**: For dense scatter plots, useful in showing density.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multivariate Analysis** (Analyzing more than two variables)\n",
    "   - **Pair Plot**: Matrix of scatter plots for multiple variables.\n",
    "   - **Correlation Matrix**: Shows correlation coefficients between multiple variables.\n",
    "   - **Heatmap**: Visualizes the correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Missing Data\n",
    "- **Imputation**: Filling missing values with mean, median, mode, or using advanced techniques like KNN imputation.\n",
    "- **Deletion**: Removing rows or columns with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outlier Detection and Treatment\n",
    "- **Box Plot Analysis**: Detects outliers visually.\n",
    "- **Z-Score or IQR Method**: Quantitatively detects outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering\n",
    "- **Transformation**: Log, square root, or exponential transformations to handle skewed data.\n",
    "- **Encoding**: One-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical variables.\n",
    "- **Scaling**: Normalizing or standardizing numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods Used in Specific Situations\n",
